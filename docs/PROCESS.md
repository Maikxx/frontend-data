## Week 1

### Day 1

Today I focussed on setting up the boilerplate once more, this time with [TypeScript](typescript), because I felt like I was really missing that in the past few weeks.

I got stuck at creating my own TypeScript configurator a lot today.
I just Googled my way to the correct use cases (which in my case was having both [Nodemon](nodemon) and TypeScript).

I have found that TypeScript is great, when you can get it up and running, but setting up an environment is not really simple, making it less appealing for creating a quick app.

When I finally got it to work, I decided to start transforming the data from the OBA API to [TypeScript types](../api/types/Query.ts).
I did this, mainly, because I think it will be easier for me to see a pattern of data, which is interesting to explore.
[Last projects visualization](https://beta.observablehq.com/@maikxx/division-of-books-per-language-at-the-oba) was not very exciting, so I am trying to make it exciting this time.
