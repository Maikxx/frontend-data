## Week 1

### Day 1

Today I focussed on setting up the boilerplate once more, this time with [TypeScript](typescript), because I felt like I was really missing that in the past few weeks.

I got stuck at creating my own [TypeScript](typescript) configurator a lot today.
I just Googled my way to the correct use cases (which in my case was having both [Nodemon](nodemon) and [TypeScript](typescript)).

I have found that [TypeScript](typescript) is great, when you can get it up and running, but setting up an environment is not really simple, making it less appealing for creating a quick app.
